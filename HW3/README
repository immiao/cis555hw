Did you complete any extra-credit tasks? If so, which ones?
  (list extra-credit tasks)
No.

Any special instructions for building and running your solution?
  (include detailed instructions, or write 'None')

How to run my program:
Use 'ant master' to set up a master server. Default port is 8000.
Use 'ant worker1' to set up a worker, whose port is 8001 and directory is 'database0'.
Use 'ant worker2' to set up a worker, whose port is 8002 and directory is 'database1'.
Use 'ant worker3' to set up a worker, whose port is 8003 and directory is 'database2'.
Edit the build.xml file to change the command-line parameters of these servers.

Some details:
1. My program is able to execute a next job without restarting these servers. I shut down the
cluster(but not the worker) after each job. Defining a new job will start a new cluster thread.

2. Use /shutdown to shut down all the workers. In order to receive response from the workers,
I use a shut-down thread to shut down the worker. Worker will response to the master first,
start the shut-down thread, and wait for 2 seconds then shut down itself.
